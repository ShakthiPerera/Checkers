# Checkers

This is a Checkers engine is which built with minmax algorithm.The algorithm using only the minmax algorithm and not optimized with alpha beta pruning.This was built with the help of techwithtim checkers engine tutorial.

# MinMax Algorithm

The mini-max algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm that's used for making decisions and game theory. It provides a player with an optimal move if the opponent is also playing well.

The Min-Max algorithm is mainly used for game playing in AI. It is also used for calculating the minimax decision for various game types.

In this game, two players play against each other, with the objective of getting the maximum benefit from the game. The game is played by two players, who are referred to as MAX and MIN.

The minimax algorithm is a deep-dive search algorithm that aims to find the complete game tree. It recursively searches the tree and returns the result.
